                    <h3>Come and shop with us</h3>
                    <p>Boxer is one of the fastest growing discount supermarkets in Southern Africa. With a cemented set of ‘people centered’ goals and values, we have positioned ourselves as ‘Africa’s Favourite Discount Supermarket’ - a discounter that caters for the needs of the enlarged middle to lower income consumer market. Since our beginnings, more than four decades ago in 1977, in KwaZulu-Natal’s Empangeni community, the Boxer brand has grown far and wide and includes well defined retail offerings that boast stores spread in every province of South Africa, as well as in the Kingdom of Eswatini. 
                        Retail giant Pick n Pay acquired Boxer in 2002 in order for the Group to best serve the consumer market place that Boxer continues to dominate in. Boxer actively seeks opportunities with established brands to further entrench accessibility to its consumers.
